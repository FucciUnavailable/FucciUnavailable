- 👋 Hi, I’m @FucciUnavailable, this is technically a new Github Account made to showcase a clean portfolio (as opposed to my other github accounts which include all sorts of side and personal projects)
- 👀 I’m interested in EVERYTHING I don't know, and I really don't know much
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced javascript frameworks as well as scientific python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on node projects, anything database related (sql or nosql), API development and more
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Ants farm a type of fungus called Lepiotaceae which can process the nectar from leaves better than they can, the same way we farm cows?
